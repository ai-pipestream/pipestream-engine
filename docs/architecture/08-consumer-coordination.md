# Consumer Coordination

> **Note:** This document is superseded by [Kafka Sidecar Pattern](./08-kafka-sidecar.md).
> 
> The sidecar pattern eliminates the need for complex consumer coordination inside the engine.
> Consul session-based leases in the sidecar handle topic distribution.

See [08-kafka-sidecar.md](./08-kafka-sidecar.md) for the current design.
